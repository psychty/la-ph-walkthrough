The estimated number is rounded to the nearest 100.","Unit":"proportion","Timeperiod":"2019","Area_name":"Wealden","Area_code":"E07000065","Value":8.0641,"Numerator":4018.593,"Denominator":49833,"Label":"8.1% (4,000 older people)","Label_screen":"8.1%","Notes":"This indicator is from the 2019 Index of multiple deprivation although the population used in calculations is based on 2015 estimates.","line_1":"of older people","line_2":"aged 60+ living on","line_3":"low incomes from","line_4":"English indices of","line_5":"deprivation 2019","img_path":"./images/coins-stack.svg","Polarity":"Not applicable","Comp_Value":14.1975,"Comp_Numerator":1790711.808,"x":0.52,"y":0.8,"Significance":"Not applicable","Colour":"#8E8E8E"},{"ID":"90356","Name":"Fuel poverty","Description":"This is the proportion of households experienceing fuel poverty (low income, high costs method).","Unit":"proportion","Timeperiod":"2017","Area_name":"Wealden","Area_code":"E07000065","Value":8.3,"Numerator":5529,"Denominator":66747,"Label":"8.3%","Label_screen":"8.3%","line_1":"of households","line_2":"experiencing","line_3":"fuel poverty (low","line_4":"income, high cost","line_5":"method) in2017","img_path":"./images/flame.svg","Polarity":"Not applicable","Comp_Value":10.9161,"Comp_Numerator":2532195,"x":0.44,"y":0.8,"Significance":"Not applicable","Colour":"#8E8E8E"},{"ID":"41401","Name":"Hip fractures in people aged 65 and over","Description":"This is the rate of emergency admissions for hip fractures among those aged 65 years and older per 100,000 population.","Unit":"rate","Timeperiod":"2018/19","Area_name":"Wealden","Area_code":"E07000065","Value":338.13,"Lower_CI":285.1,"Upper_CI":398.1,"Numerator":145,"Denominator":41533,"Label":"338 per 100,000 (95% CI 285-398, 145 admissions)","Label_screen":"338 per 100,000","line_1":"rate of emergency","line_2":"admissions for hip","line_3":"fractures among those","line_4":"aged 65 in 2018/19","line_5":"(145 admissions)","img_path":"./images/hip-bone.svg","Polarity":"Lower is better","Comp_Value":558.41,"Comp_Lower_CI":553.9,"Comp_Upper_CI":563,"Comp_Numerator":57675,"x":0.36,"y":0.8,"Significance":"Significantly lower","Colour":"#3ECC26"},{"ID":"90360","Name":"Excess winter deaths index","Description":"This is the ratio of extra deaths from all causes that occur in the winter months (December to March) compared with the expected number based on the average of the number of non-winter deaths.
